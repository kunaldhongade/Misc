      <h2>Dessehra Information:-</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Dussehra, also called Dasara or Vijayadashami, in Hinduism, holiday
        marking the triumph of Rama, an avatar of Vishnu, over the 10-headed
        demon king Ravana, who abducted Rama’s wife, Sita. The festival’s name
        is derived from the Sanskrit words dasha (“ten”) and hara (“defeat”).
        Symbolizing the victory of good over evil, Dussehra is celebrated on the
        10th day of the month of Ashvina (September–October), the seventh month
        of the Hindu calendar, with the appearance of the full moon, an event
        called the “bright fortnight” (shukla paksha). Dussehra coincides with
        the culmination of the nine-day Navratri festival and with the tenth day
        of the Durga Puja festival. For many, it marks the beginning of
        preparation for Diwali, which occurs 20 days after Dussehra.

      <h1>Significance of The Festival</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        Dussehra is a festival that indicates the victory of good over evil. It
        also signifies that wrongdoings must be revelled and punished on some of
        the other days. Whenever any evil push head and forces on you, the
        excellent power will prevent you. Truth, good energy, righteousness
        always win the battle. In some part of India, people consider it as a
        day of starting new investments or business. In south India, on this day
        some people admit their children to schools.

      <h2>What do you do on this day:-</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Draw a rangoli with colorful powder at the entrance to your house. You
        can use rangoli powder, rice flour, or sand. Sweep the area to get rid
        of dirt. Then use your thumb and pointer finger to pinch the powder and
        sprinkle it into a design, whether it’s a drawing of the goddess Durga
        or a geometric pattern of concentric circles and shapes.[4] It doesn’t
        matter what you draw, as long as you use bright colors to invite
        happiness into your home.
      </p>
      <p>
        Light up your space with diyas and string lights. Diyas are small oil
        lamps made from clay that are often placed around the border of a
        rangoli or in a prayer room. You can also drape strands of LED lights
        inside your home. Not only do lots of lights look pretty and festive,
        they also indicate the presence of good (light) and the absence of evil
        (darkness)
      </p>
      <p>
        Arrange dolls on a 9-step platform to represent the nights of Navaratri.
        Every Dussehra, most households set up bommala koluvu, an exhibition of
        assorted dolls and figurines meant to represent the 3 goddesses
        (Lakshmi, Parvati, and Saraswati). Begin by covering the platform in a
        light-colored cloth, then setting the dolls on each step based on their
        theme
