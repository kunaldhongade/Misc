        <h1>Victoria Memorial, Kolkata</h1>
        <p>The Victoria Memorial in Kolkata is one of the most historical tourist places in India and was built during the peak of the British era in India. The then Viceroy Lord Curzon laid down the idea of this monument but its actual design was done by Sir William Emerson.

            Multitudes of lush gardens, a museum filled with British memorabilia including weapons, paintings, sculptures, artifacts etc and royal portrait of the Queen are what you will find in this beautiful monument. One of the best paintings you will find here is the one by Russian artist Vasili Verestchagin. This painting depicts the Prince of Wales in Jaipur in 1876.
            
            Interesting fact: There are two sets of mysterious inscriptions on the monument. One is “VRI” which means Victoria Regina Imperatrix and the other is “Dieu Et Mon Droit”. The first means Victoria Queen and Empress and the latter means “God and my right”.
            Entry fee: Indians- INR 20
